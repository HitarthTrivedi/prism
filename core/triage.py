Prism — sorting the inbox
─────────────────────────
Decides what each message *is*: a real inquiry, a purchase order, a payment
advice, a newsletter, a supplier, internal post.

Local rules run first and settle most of it. Only what the rules genuinely
cannot place is shown to an AI, and only a short snippet of it. That ordering
is the privacy promise made concrete:

    · a newsletter never leaves the computer — it carries List-Unsubscribe
    · a known customer or supplier never leaves the computer — we know them
    · an auto-reply never leaves the computer — it says so in its headers
    · a corrected sender never leaves the computer again — see learn()

What is left is the handful of genuinely new correspondents each day. Set
`local_only` and even those stay in, sorted as UNSORTED for a human to glance
at. The feature still works; it just asks a bit more of the owner.

Nothing here decides anything about money. Sorting a message wrongly costs a
few seconds; that is why this layer is allowed to be automatic at all.
