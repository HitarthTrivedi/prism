Prism — the pending-work files
───────────────────────────────
The working dialog's tabs used to show only what the LAST check happened to
find. Each check's result was held in memory and nowhere else, so the moment
the inbox's own read bookmark moved past a message, whatever had been shown
for it was gone — switching tabs, or simply reopening the dialog the next
morning, was enough to lose a customer's reply that still needed an answer,
or a purchase order nobody had accepted yet.

This is the fix: one plain JSON file per section, inside a `worklist/`
folder next to the register, appended to every time a check finds something
(or Prism sends something) and read back every time a tab needs to draw
itself — so what is on screen is never just "since the last check", it is
"everything that has not been dealt with yet", however many checks ago it
arrived. The owner asked for exactly this — "a file for every section and
every phase" — and one file per section is also what makes the folder
readable by eye: open `replies.json` and it is the replies, nothing else.

    <inquiry folder>/worklist/
        arrived.json    every mail Prism sorted — a permanent log; nothing
                        here is ever "done", it exists so a sender can be
                        found again next week, not just glimpsed once
        replies.json    a customer's answer to a quotation — resolved once
                        it is applied to the register
        orders.json     a purchase order read off the mail — resolved once
                        it is accepted or otherwise dealt with
        sent.json       every mail Prism sent on the owner's behalf — a
                        quotation, a reminder, a win-back — so "Waiting on a
                        reply" can say "reminder sent 24-08, 25-08" instead
                        of just a count

An older Prism kept all of this in one `worklist.json`. migrate() folds that
file into the four above the first time anything reads the folder, and
leaves the original behind as `worklist.json.bak` — never deleted, never
rewritten, because it might be the only copy of something.

Every write is atomic, same discipline as register.py: a crash mid-write
must never truncate the only record of what still needs a reply.

The logs (`arrived`, `sent`) are still capped, for the working file to stay
small enough to rewrite on every check. What the cap evicts used to simply
be deleted — silently, and in contradiction to the promise above. It is not
deleted any more: it is appended, one JSON object per line, to
`arrived.archive.jsonl` / `sent.archive.jsonl` next to the working file,
before the working file is trimmed. Nothing a customer sent is gone; it has
just moved to the file a person, not a tab, reads.
